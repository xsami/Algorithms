# Binary String Addition

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, add them together and return the resulting string.

## Example

For `a = "1000"` and `b = "111"`, the output should be
`addBinaryStrings(a, b) = "1111";`
For `a = "1"` and `b = "1"`, the output should be
`addBinaryStrings(a, b) = "10"`.
